## Dynamics + Galaxies + Accelerations + Differentiable + Friendly

A general pure Julia package for Galactic Dynamics considering General Relativity.

## Inspired by the great packages:
- [Galpy (Python/C)](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy)
- [Gala (Python/C++/Cython/C)](https://github.com/adrn/gala)
- [Agama (Python/C++)](https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama)

## 🚧 Work in progress! This package is not ready for production. 🛠️
